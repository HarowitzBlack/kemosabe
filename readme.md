### Kemosabe - Bot building framework for messenger

Kemosabe is a bot building framework for Messenger built on top of Flask. It is simple and quite easy
to use. It scales pretty well too. It supports most of the Messenger API componants.
The core idea behind Kemosabe is to not worry about spending too much time, thinking
about how to link different interactions, or features so that the resulting outcome
is seamless.

***

#### Installation

```
pip3 install kemosabe
```
***

##### Here's an example of a simple an echo bot

##### app.py
```python

import kemosabe,views

events = {
    "@get_started":views.get_started,
    "@text":views.text,
}

bot = kemosabe.Kemosabe(events)
bot.set_keys(api_key="<api_key>",verify_key="<verify_key>")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot.run(port=5622,debug=True)

```

##### create views.py to create events.

```python
  import kemosabe

  # triggered when the get started button is tapped
  def get_started(session):
      uid = session.id
      kemosabe.send_text_message(uid,"Hello there!")

  # triggered when any text is sent. This event just sends an echo of the message
  def text(session):
      uid = session.id
      kemosabe.send_text_message(uid,session.text)

```

##### Create a configs.json file with "api_key" and "verify_key" as keys in it.
```json

  { "api_key":"<cdcfvfv>","verify_key":"<key>" }

```

# A little bit of theory üìª

## Events

Every Interaction or event must be encupsulated within a function. And each function
can do one or more tasks. Now each function must be mapped with an event-tag.
(An event-tag is basically a string that corresponds to a function. It can be created
like this "@someevent". The event-tag must start with an '@'). Then the events are passed
into a function where it waits for the events to trigger.

## Session Object

Each function you create gets a session object. This object contains the 'important stuff'.
Here the 'important stuff' is the response sent by the user. Typically, the
response sent by the user is a massive JSON object. But the internal parser
picks the important stuff and puts them into the session object. The session object
contains the user's id, the message sent by the user, the action that the user triggered
and developer created variables, etc.

So, what's the point of this? Well, keeping track of variables that are necessery
for the future interaction is really crucial. It defines how smart your bot is.
You wouldn't want to build a dumb bot that can't remember stuff right? The other reason
for the session object is that messenger app doesn't offer space to store sessions unlike
browsers which do. The only problem with the session object is it's not permanent. It only
persists for a single future interaction, because it gets updated by the new session object.
So you better store the important stuff in a database.

### Messenger Componants and how to use them üñ•

###### Quick Reply Buttons

Sending quick reply buttons is pretty easy. It involves of 3 steps.

###### + creating an action trigger
###### + creating the button
###### + Sending the button

##### Creating an action trigger

```python
  altered_carbon = kemosabe.create_action(action='tvshow',type='altered_carbon')
```
Calling the *create_action()* method generates an action string. This string contains the information,
which is used by kemosabe to trigger the right event. To create an action, the first param is action.
It is a required parameter, it's value corresponds to the event key in the event dict you created.
Here there's no need to add the '@' since the function automatically does that for you. The other
parameters are defined by you. These parameters can be accessed using the session object(session.altered_carbon).

##### Creating the button

```python
   payload = (
             ["Altered Carbon üë®‚Äçüé§",altered_carbon,"text"], #
             ...
             ...
  )
```

A button is a tuple containing lists. Each list inside the tuple is a button. Building the button involves
passing 3 items into the list. Text you want to display on the button, the action string you created earlier and the button type.
Any number of buttons can be created (Messengers limit is 10). 'text' is the only type for quick reply buttons.

##### Sending the button

```python
    kemosabe.send_quick_reply(uid,"What's your favorite TV show? üì∫",payload)
```

Now pack everything and send it using the *send_quick_reply()* method. The first parameter is the user's messenger id.
It can be accessed by using the session object (session.uid). The next parameter is the text message you want to send.
The final parameter is the tuple you created earlier. That's it. You've created and sent a quick reply button.


#### Todo  üî®üìª

- [ ] Add all Messenger componants
- [ ] recieve Image, video and audio
- [ ] Trigger event when location,image,video or audio is sent.
